 <h2>Hello, I'm</h2>
    <h1><span class="name-accent">Jhayne!</span></h1>
    </div>
    <p>I'm a Digital Design student at George Brown College. Outside of school, I'm a maker who mixes systems thinking with feral DIY sensibilities.</p>
  <p>This site showcases my incredibly rusty HTML and a little bit of CSS with a few simple pages. While some of it was built from memory (thank you MySpace and LiveJournal), I also did a lot of Googling. Props to all the kind people on Reddit who have already asked "what is that thingy called" type questions so I could find the answers now, years and years later. </p>
  <p>Unreasonably, however, all my CSS commenting is purely my own, built from years of working with incredibly intense engineers who never commented their stuff, ever, and were the bane of many of my working days. Thanks, guys. Thanks so much. </p>
